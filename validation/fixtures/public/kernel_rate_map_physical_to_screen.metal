// Eight physical coordinates mapped to screen coordinates through a rasterization rate map whose
// rate is a uniform 1.0.
//
// `air.map_physical_to_screen_coordinates.v2f32.p2i8.i32` (8 case-less corpus sources) -- the
// direction opposite the one `blit-through-a-uniform-rasterization-rate-map` pinned.
//
// This translator lowers the call to the identity. That is correct for a map whose every horizontal
// and vertical rate is 1.0 and whose physical size equals its screen size, and nothing pinned it in
// this direction. Buffer 0 carries the real parameter data of such a map -- 64x64 screen, one
// layer, eight rates of 1.0 on each axis, straight out of
// `MTLRasterizationRateMap.copyParameterData`. Our reflection reports that buffer Unused, because
// the identity model never reads it: the Metal side decodes real map data and the Vulkan side does
// not, so the two agree only if the identity is the right answer.
//
// The eight coordinates are chosen so that a wrong answer cannot hide.
//
//   * Four are INSIDE the map -- (0, 0), (1.5, 2.5), (31.25, 47.75), (63.5, 63.5) -- spanning the
//     origin, the far corner and two interior points whose fractions are quarters. A decoder that
//     rounded to texel centres or floored to integers moves three of them.
//   * Three are OUTSIDE it, which is what the corpus never asks: (64, 64) is exactly one past the
//     far edge, (80, 7.25) is sixteen past it on one axis only, and (-3.5, 2) is negative on one
//     axis only. These separate the identity from a clamp to the map's extent, which would answer
//     63-and-a-bit, 63-and-a-bit and 0 where the identity answers 64, 80 and -3.5.
//   * The last, (8.125, 55.875), is asymmetric in both axes, so a transposed mapping is visible.
//
// Every coordinate is an exact binary fraction below 128, so all sixteen output words are exact in
// binary32 and the comparison needs no tolerance.
//
// **The identity is not Metal's answer everywhere, and the boundary is measured.** On this map
// Metal is exactly the identity out to x = 95, and at x = 96 it returns 0 -- not a clamp to 63.x,
// which is why "outside the extent" alone does not describe it. 100.5 was in an earlier draft of
// this file and Metal answered 0.0 for it; the bisect that followed put the break between 95 and
// 96, one and a half times the 64-wide screen. So the case stays inside the domain the identity is
// measured to hold on, and the divergence past it is recorded rather than papered over: a shader
// that asks this call for a coordinate more than half a screen past the physical extent will get a
// different answer from us than from Metal, and none of the eight corpus sources does.
