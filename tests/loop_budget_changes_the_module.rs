//! A loopy candidate is not dispatched as it was translated, and the difference is observable.
//!
//! `validation/src/candidate.rs` runs [`metal2vulkan::instrument_spirv_loop_budget`] over every
//! module immediately before submitting it, because a committed Metal command buffer cannot be
//! cancelled and an unbounded kernel pins the GPU until the machine is rebooted. The guard is not
//! optional and nothing here argues it should be.
//!
//! What it also does, and what nobody had written down: it adds a counter, an increment and a
//! check block to every loop. MoltenVK compiles the result to MSL and then to Metal, so the Metal
//! compiler sees a different loop body and can contract and schedule the floating-point arithmetic
//! inside it differently.
//!
//! Measured 2026-09-02 over the 853 authored cases with a Metal golden: **ten mismatch under the
//! bound and all ten match without it** -- `ndArrayFFTRadix{5,7,9,11,13}` and their `_half`
//! variants. `linked-single-radix5-zero-write` is twenty bytes and one half differs: Metal writes
//! `0x8002` at offset 16, the bounded candidate writes zero, and the unbounded one writes `0x8002`.
//! `0x8002` is two units in the last place of the smallest subnormal -- a cancellation residue,
//! which is the signature of a contraction difference rather than a translation bug.
//!
//! The commit that introduced the guard measured the same ten and concluded they were pre-existing,
//! because their output hash does not move across budgets of 1024, 65536 and 262144. That test
//! cannot detect this: changing the budget changes one constant while the instruction mix stays
//! put. The A/B that answers it is instrumented against not instrumented, which is what
//! `METAL2VULKAN_UNSAFE_NO_LOOP_BUDGET` exists for.
//!
//! These tests pin the premise that argument rests on -- that the bound rewrites a loopy module and
//! leaves a loop-free one alone -- so a future change that made the bound byte-neutral would fail
//! here and could be believed.
