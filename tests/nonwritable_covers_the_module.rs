//! A `NonWritable` descriptor is one the module cannot write.
//!
//! Vulkan reads the absence of this decoration as a demand rather than as silence: a graphics-stage
//! module that declares an undecorated storage buffer OR STORAGE IMAGE requires its consumer to
//! enable `fragmentStoresAndAtomics` or `vertexPipelineStoresAndAtomics`, whether or not any store
//! exists (`VUID-RuntimeSpirv-NonWritable-06340` and `-06341`). Measured over the corpus before the
//! decoration was emitted: 11193 of 14579 sources declared at least one buffer they never write,
//! 2343 of them in a graphics stage, and every one of those asked its consumer for a feature the
//! shader does not use. The image half is the same VUID reached differently: 264 graphics-stage
//! modules still demanded the feature after the buffer half landed, and 164 of them stop once the
//! storage images they never write are decorated.
//!
//! The decoration is an assertion the runtime is entitled to act on -- a driver may place the
//! buffer in read-only memory, or skip a barrier for it -- and `spirv-val` does not check it
//! against the stores in the module. A wrong one is therefore silent all the way to the device.
//! This file supplies the check `spirv-val` does not: an independent walk of the disassembly that
//! roots every derived pointer at the variable it came from, and fails if a store, a copy, or a
//! read-modify-write atomic lands on a decorated one -- and, for images, roots every image object
//! at the variable it was loaded from and fails on a write through one.
//!
//! Only one direction is a defect. The translator may leave a descriptor undecorated that no
//! instruction writes -- the proof requires Logical addressing, an unwritten descriptor, and no
//! pointer escaping into an operand slot the analysis does not model, and any of the three failing
//! costs only the decoration. This file checks the direction that is not.
